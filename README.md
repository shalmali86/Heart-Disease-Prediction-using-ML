Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
Heart disease prevention has become crucial, and developing reliable, data-driven prediction systems can significantly enhance both research and prevention efforts, helping more people lead healthier lives. Machine learning (ML) offers powerful tools for predicting heart disease with a high degree of accuracy.

In this project, we analyzed a heart disease dataset, performing thorough data preprocessing and training various ML models to make predictions. The algorithms applied include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and more, using Python and popular libraries such as Scikit-learn and Keras.

Approach and Methodology
This classification task involves using features such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure to predict a binary outcome: the presence or absence of heart disease.

Machine Learning Algorithms Used:
Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
K-Nearest Neighbors (Scikit-learn)
Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
Artificial Neural Network with one hidden layer (Keras)
Results:
Among all models, Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 95%.

Dataset:
We used the UCI Heart Disease dataset available on Kaggle.

The project was developed in a Jupyter Notebook and shared as a Kaggle kernel, "Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras." By leveraging multiple algorithms, this project highlights the effectiveness of ML in predicting heart disease accurately.
